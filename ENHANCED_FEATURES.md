### CSS Animations:
```css
@keyframes pingSpawn {
  0% { transform: scale(0); opacity: 0; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.3); opacity: 0.8; }
  100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes pingPulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.5); opacity: 0.7; }
}
```

### Snap-to-Ping Logic:

2. **Smart Following**: Auto-zoom to see where teammates are pinging
3. **Cleaner Interface**: More space for the map, better organization
4. **Enhanced UX**: Smoother interactions and better feedback

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy to your server at `172.105.151.47:8080`
2. Test with multiple guild members
3. Verify animations work smoothly
4. Confirm snap-to-ping functionality
