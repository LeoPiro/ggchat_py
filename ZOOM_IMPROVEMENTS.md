# 🔍 Zoom Level Improvements

## ✅ Changes Made:

### 📉 **Extended Zoom Out Range**
- **Before**: `minZoom: -1` (limited zoom out)
- **After**: `minZoom: -2` (can zoom out much further)
- **Benefit**: Users can see much more of the map at once

### 🎯 **Fixed Snap-to-Ping Zoom**
- **Before**: `Math.max(map.getZoom(), 1)` (forced high zoom if already zoomed in)
- **After**: Fixed at `zoom: 1` (consistent, comfortable zoom level)
- **Benefit**: Always zooms to a good viewing level, not too close

## 📊 Zoom Level Details:

### Zoom Scale Reference:
- **-2**: Maximum zoom out - entire map visible
- **-1**: Wide view - good for strategic overview
- **0**: Default starting zoom - balanced view
- **1**: Snap-to-ping zoom - good detail without being too close
- **2**: Close zoom - detailed area view
- **3**: Maximum zoom in - very detailed view

### User Experience Improvements:

#### Better Navigation:
- **Zoom out further** to see the entire guild territory
- **Strategic overview** at -2 zoom level
- **Tactical planning** possible with wider view

#### Consistent Snap-to-Ping:
- **Always zooms to level 1** when someone pings
- **No more forced extreme zoom** if you were already zoomed in
- **Comfortable viewing distance** for seeing ping context

#### Practical Benefits:
- **Guild coordination**: See multiple areas at once
- **Route planning**: Zoom out to plan travel routes
- **Area awareness**: Better understanding of map layout
- **Consistent experience**: Predictable snap-to-ping behavior

## 🎮 Usage Tips:

### For Guild Leaders:
- **Zoom out to -2** for strategic overviews during events
- **Use snap-to-ping** to quickly see where members are calling attention
- **Plan group activities** with the wider view capability

### For Guild Members:
- **Zoom out** to see where you are relative to others' pings
- **Use the wider view** to understand map geography better
- **Snap-to-ping** will always give you a good view of the ping location

## 🚀 Technical Implementation:

```javascript
// Extended zoom range
minZoom: -2,  // From -1 to -2 (more zoom out)
maxZoom: 3,   // Unchanged (same max zoom in)

// Fixed snap-to-ping zoom
map.setView([lat, lng], 1, {  // Fixed at zoom 1
    animate: true,
    duration: 1.0
});
```

Perfect for guild coordination and map navigation! 🗺️
